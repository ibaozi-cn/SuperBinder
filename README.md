## SuperBinder

SuperBinder is a high-performance Android inter-process communication framework designed to address the pain points of the Android Binder framework. By using SuperBinder, developers can easily pass data and invoke methods between different processes, improving the performance, ease-of-use, and security of their applications.

## Key Features

- **High-performance**: SuperBinder offers lower latency and higher throughput in inter-process communication compared to the traditional Android Binder.
- **Easy to learn**: The API is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing developers to quickly integrate it without complex configuration.
- **Reduced code complexity**: Avoiding the use of AIDL, SuperBinder provides a more concise interface definition, reducing code complexity and improving maintainability.
- **Large data transfer**: SuperBinder supports the transfer of data larger than 1MB, automatically handling data splitting and combination, thus relieving developers of manual management.
- **Enhanced security**: SuperBinder incorporates security mechanisms to prevent malicious applications from exploiting IPC communication, ensuring data integrity and privacy during transmission.

## Getting Started

Add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'www.ibaozi.cn:superbinder:0.0.1'
}
```

## Usage Example

Provide a simple code example demonstrating how to use your framework in a project. For example:

```java
// On the server side, create a service class extending SuperIPCService
public class MyService extends SuperIPCService {
    // Implement your service methods
    public String getData() {
        return "Hello from SuperIPC!";
    }
}

// On the client side, call the server-side method like this
SuperIPCClient client = new SuperIPCClient(context, MyService.class);
String data = client.call("getData", String.class);
```
